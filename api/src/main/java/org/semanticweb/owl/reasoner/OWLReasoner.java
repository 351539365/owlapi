 * reasoner creation time and remains fixed from then on.  The set of ontologies can be obtained using the
 * {@link #getOntologies()} method.  When the client responsible for creating the reasoner has finished with the
 * reasoner instance it must call the {@link #dispose()} method to free any resources that are used by the reasoner.
 * In general, reasoners should not be instantiated directly, but should be created using the appropriate
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owl.reasoner.OWLReasonerFactory}.
