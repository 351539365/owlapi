 * An BufferedOWLReasoner reasons over a set of ontologies.  The set of ontologies is defined at
 * reasoner creation time and remains fixed from then on.  The set of ontologies can be obtained using the
 * {@link #getAxioms()} method.  When the client responsible for creating the reasoner has finished with the
 * reasoner instance it must call the {@link #dispose()} method to free any resources that are used by the reasoner.
 * In general, reasoners should not be instantiated directly, but should be created using the appropriate
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.OWLReasonerFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After the initial set of ontologies have been loaded/processed at reasoner creation time,
 * a BufferedOWLReasoner listens to changes in the loaded ontologies and stores them in a buffer.  The changes are
 * only applied to the ontologies within the reasoner and therefore only affect reasoning when the buffer is flushed
 * manually by a client calling the {@link #flush()} method.
