/**
 * Author: Matthew Horridge<br> The University of Manchester<br> Information Management Group<br>
 * Date: 21-Jan-2009
 * <p>
 * An OWLReasoner reasons over a set of axioms that is defined by the imports closure of a particular ontology - the
 * "root" ontology.  This ontology can be obtained using the {@link OWLReasoner#getRootOntology()} method.
 * When the client responsible for creating the reasoner has finished with the
 * reasoner instance it must call the {@link #dispose()} method to free any resources that are used by the reasoner.
 * In general, reasoners should not be instantiated directly, but should be created using the appropriate
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.OWLReasonerFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Change Management</h2>
 * At creation time, an OWLReasoner will attach itself as a listener to the {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntologyManager}
 * that manages the root ontology.  The reasoner will listen to any
 * {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntologyChange}s and respond to these so that any queries that are asked after
 * the ontology changes are answered with respect to the changed ontologies.  Note that this does not guarentee that
 * the reasoner implementation will respond to changes in an incremental (and efficient manner) manner.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Nodes</h2>
 * The reasoner interface contains methods that return {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.NodeSet}s.  These are
 * sets of {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node}s.  A <code>Node</code> contains entities.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLClass&gt;</code>
 * of classes, each class in the node is equivalent to the other classes in the <code>Node</code> with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLObjectProperty&gt;</code> of object properties, each
 * object property in the <code>Node</code> is equivalent to the other object properties in the node with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLDataProperty&gt;</code> of data properties, each data property
 * in the <code>Node</code> is equivalent to the other data properties in the node with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * </p>
 * For a <code>Node&lt;OWLNamedIndividual&gt;</code> of named individuals, each individual in the node
 * is the same as the other individuals in the node with respect to the
 * imports closure of the root ontology.
 * <p/>
 * By abuse of notation, we say that a <code>NodeSet</code> "contains" an entity if that entity is contained in one
 * of the <code>Nodes</code> in the <code>NodeSet</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Hierarchies</h2>
 *
 * A hierachy (class hierachy, object property hierarchy, data property hierarchy) is viewed as a directed acyclic
 * graph (DAG) containing nodes connected via edges.  Each node in the hierarchy represents a set of entities that
 * are equivalent to each other.  Each hierarchy has a top node (see {@link Node#isTopNode()}) and a bottom node
 * (see {@link Node#isBottomNode()}).
 * </p>
 * The figure below shows an example class hierarchy.  Each box in the hierarchy represents a <code>Node</code>.  In
 * this case the top node contains <code>owl:Thing</code> and the bottom node contains <code>owl:Nothing</code>
 * because the nodes in the hierarchy are <code>OWLClass</code> nodes.  In this case, class <code>G</code>
 * is equivalent to <code>owl:Thing</code> so it appears as an entity in the top node along with <code>owl:Thing</code>.
 * Similarly, class <code>K</code> is unsatisfiable, so it is equivalent to <code>owl:Nothing</code>, and therefore
 * appears in the bottom node containing <code>owl:Nothing</code>.  In this example, classes <code>A</code> and
 * <code>B</code> are equivalent so they appear in one node, also, classes <code>D</code> and <code>F</code> are
 * equivalent so they appear in one node.
 * </p>
 * Asking for the subclasses of a given class (expression) returns the a <code>NodeSet</code> containing the nodes that contain classes
 * that are strict subclasses of the specified class (expression). For example, asking for the subclasses of class <code>C</code>
 * returns the <code>NodeSet</code> <code>{E}</code> and
 * <code>{owl:Nothing, K}</code>.
 * </p>
 * Asking for the direct subclasses of a given class (expression) returns the <code>NodeSet</code> that
 * contains the nodes that contains classes that are direct subclasses of the specified class.  For example, asking for
 * the direct subclasses of class <code>A</code> returns the <code>NodeSet</code>
 * containing the nodes <code>{C}</code> and <code>{D, F}</code>.  Note that there are convenience methods on
 * {@link NodeSet} and {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.reasoner.Node} that can be used to directly access the entities
 * in a <code>NodeSet</code> without having to iterate over the nodes and entities in a <code>NodeSet</code>. For
 * example, a "plain" set of classes contained inside the <code>Nodes</code> contained inside a <code>NodeSet</code>
 * can easily be obtained using the {@link NodeSet#getFlattened()} method.  In this case we could quickly obtain <code>{C,
 * D, F}</code> as the direct subclasses of <code>A</code> simply by using the
 * {@link #getSubClasses(org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLClassExpression, boolean)}} (with boolean=true) method on
 * <code>OWLReasoner</code> and then we could use the {@link NodeSet#getFlattened()} method on the retuned <code>NodeSet</code>.
 * </p>
 * Asking for equivalent classes of a class (expression) returns a <code>Node</code> that contains classes that are equivalent to
 * the class (expression) .  For example, asking for the equivalent classes of <code>owl:Nothing</code>
 * (i.e. asking for the unsatisfiable classes) returns the <code>Node</code> <code>{owl:Nothing, K}</code>.
