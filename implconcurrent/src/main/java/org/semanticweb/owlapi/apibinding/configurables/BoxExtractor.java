/**
 * This class allows for the extraction of subsets of axioms based on their types; the purpose is to offer a flexible extraction mechanism to collect axioms belonging to, e.g., the ABox, the TBox or the RBox of an ontology. Sets of axiom types covering these cases are available in AxiomType::TBoxAxiomTypes, AxiomType::ABoxAxiomTypes, AxiomType::RBoxAxiomType, but the class can be configured through the constructor arguments to include different subsets.
 * 
 * The idea for this construct was graciously provided by Thomas Scharrenbach, Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL (http://www.wsl.ch/info/mitarbeitende/scharren/owl-defaults/index_EN?redir=1)
 * 
 * This class does not store any internal state referring to the ontology; it is safe for use in multithread environments, provided that the parameters to the constructor do not change while the constructor executes and the OWLOntology implementation is itself threadsafe.
 * A single instance can be reused for extracting the same Box from different ontologies without side effects.
